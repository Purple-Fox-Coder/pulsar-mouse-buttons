# Pulsar Mouse Buttons

Adds support in pulsar-edit for mouse buttons

If you are finding issues trying to run this package, you may need to build it.

**PLANNED SUPPORT**
- Linux
- Windows
- pulsar-next

*Starting with just the basic forward/back buttons on mouse first, more will be added later*

# Build 
Make sure you have the following:
- powershell
- npm (6.14.19-pulsar or later *non pulsar npm may also work, but I have not tested it*) 
- node (16.x.x or later)
- node-gyp (11.x.x or later)
- windows-build-tools (the version installed by npm should work, or the 2017 version if that gives you issues.)

if you need guidance to install these, follow the [install guide](./docs/install.md).

supported platforms' build instructions:
[WINDOWS](./docs/windowsBuild.md)
[LINUX](./docs/linuxBuild.md)

Mac is currently not supported, nor do I plan to as I cannot test it.  If you wish to add mac support you are welcome to submit pull requests with your proposed changes.

# Recommended packages

*Note that list will change over time as I find more that would work well with this package*
